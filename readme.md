# Special Note For Everyone
```py
'''
Always make more than 4 Pull Requests for Hacktoberfest.
Let's say you have made only 4 Pull Requests to different projects and one project gets excluded from Hacktoberfest event.
In that case, your Pull Request to the excluded repository will not count and you have to search for even more repos to contribute to.
If you fail to make 4 valid Pull Requests by the end of October, then you cannot get swags or t-shirts.
Before contributing, check if the repo has hacktoberfest topic and that the repo is not excluded from Hacktoberfest.
